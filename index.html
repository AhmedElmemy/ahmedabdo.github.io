        <div class="job">
            <h3>Customer Support / General Affairs at Aklatna El-helwa</h3>
            <p>Aklatna El-helwa is a cake online food chain that serves Mansoura and El-Mahalla. I manage customer orders, address concerns, and handle general affairs, for example: managing their socials and accounting for orders. This job has taught me how to communicate effectively, solve customer issues, and ensure a smooth workflow. I also designed and published their webpage!</p>

        <div class="job">
            <h3>Video Editor for Beejie Bean (YouTuber)</h3>
            <p>I worked as a video editor for Beejie Bean, an Australian YouTuber, where I edited 3D animation videos and combined in-game voice lines. It was a fun and challenging experience that helped me develop skills in video editing and time management. I also created a Discord bot for her server!</p>

        <div class="job">
            <h3>Freelance Discord Bot Developer</h3>
            <p>After working with Beejie, I pursued freelancing in Discord bot development. My biggest project was contributing to a chain of bots called Dokis, where I handled both coding and dialogue writing. I'm always eager to take on new bot development challenges! The most recent one was creating a discord music bot that plays music from YouTube into Discord voice chats using Node.js (it was quite the challenge).</p>

        <div class="job">
            <h3>Sales Representative at Crazy Candy (Kids Candy Company)</h3>
            <p>When the COVID-19 pandemic broke out, I was a high schooler looking for a simple job that provided experience. I applied to many places until I found Crazy Candy, a sweets company that needed salespeople to distribute their products across Mansoura. It was an exhausting job, with long hours visiting grocery stores and convincing owners to stock our sweets. But it significantly improved my negotiation and communication skills, making it easier to make friends and connections.</p>
